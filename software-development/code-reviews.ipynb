    "- [ ] Design: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for your system?\n",
    "- [ ] Functionality: Does the code behave as the author likely intended? Is the way the code behaves good for its users?\n",
    "- [ ] Complexity: Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the future?\n",
    "- [ ] Tests: Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests?\n",
    "- [ ] Naming: Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes, methods, etc.?\n",
    "- [ ] Comments: Are the comments clear and useful?\n",
    "- [ ] Style: Does the code follow our style guides?\n",
    "- [ ] Documentation: Did the developer also update relevant documentation?\n",

    "* The functionality is good for the users of the code.\n",
    "* Any UI changes are sensible and look good.\n",

    "* The code isn’t more complex than it needs to be.\n",
    "* The developer isn’t implementing things they might need in the future but don’t know they need now.\n",
    "* Code has appropriate unit tests.\n",
    "* Tests are well-designed.\n",
    "* The developer used clear names for everything.\n",
    "* Comments are clear and useful, and mostly explain why instead of what.\n",
    "* Code is appropriately documented (generally in g3doc).\n",
    "* The code conforms to our style guides."
