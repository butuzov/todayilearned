    "- The STM has a capacity of two to six elements.\n",
    "- To overcome the size limitation, your STM collaborates with your LTM when you remember information.\n",
    "- When you read new information, your brain tries to divide the information into recognizable parts called chunks.\n",
    "- When you lack enough knowledge in your LTM, you have to rely on low-level reading of code, like letters and keywords. When doing that, you will quickly run out of space in your STM.\n",
    "- When your LTM stores enough relevant information, you can remember abstract concepts like “a for-loop in Java” or “selection sort in Python” instead of the code at a lower level, occupying less space in your STM.\n",
    "- When you read code, it is first stored in the iconic memory. Only a bit of the code is subsequently sent to the STM.\n",
    "- Remembering code can be used as a tool for (self) diagnosis of your knowledge of coding. Because you can most easily remember what you already know, the parts of code that you remember can reveal the design patterns, programming constructs, and domain concepts you are most familiar with.\n",
    "- Code can contain characteristics that make it easier to process, such as design patterns, comments, and explicit beacons."
