    * What's the general working process? Can you describe one day or one week of the team's work?
    * What does a team look like? How many people, which positions?
    * What technology stack do you use? Why did you pick this one over similar ones? (In case they say "we only use latest technology" - what are "latest technologies" and what are their advantages?)
    * How would you describe code quality of your product?
    * How do you have your code reviews?
    * How so you take care of technical debt?
    * Do you value speed of development over quality of the product or the other way around?
    * How do you make sure your product works as expected?
    * How does your release process look like?
    * What product am I going to work on?

2. Working with customers

    * How do you, as a company/team, make sure you're working on the right things?

    * How diverse is your team? Do you have a diversity commitment?
