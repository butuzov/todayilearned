  * See also `decision making with fuzzing advantages on alternatives set` [[1]](https://github.com/butuzov/CS122-KPI/tree/master/Decision-Theory/Control_Work_2), [[2]](https://github.com/butuzov/CS122-KPI/blob/master/Analytic-Ierarchy-Process/iararchy-analysys-methods)

## Rating charts

Similar to previous on `Options`. Simple charts for decision making.

| FACTOR |    | CAR vs Bike | Total: CAR vs Bike |
|--------|----|-------------|--------------------|
| Safety | 10 | 10  vs   1  |         10 vs 1    |
| Park   | 2  | 4   vs   6  |          8 vs 12   |
