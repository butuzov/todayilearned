    "# Well, That Escalated Quickly\n",

    "In 2018, Spencer Gietzen wrote an excellent article on privilege escalation in AWS, identifying 21 separate methods across various AWS services. I have often used Spencer’s article on engagements to try and find privilege escalation paths in client environments. In doing so, I sometimes needed just a little more information. Some of the escalation techniques identified by Spencer require in-depth knowledge of specific services, or are part of a multi-step process. I wanted to understand more about those details. What are the prerequisites and limitations? What does the escalation path actually look like in practice? To answer these questions, I took it upon myself to test Spencer’s methods. I created the exploit scenarios for each of the 21 techniques in my own AWS environment and verified that I was able to escalate privileges with all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found these exercises to be very helpful for fully understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by certain AWS permissions, and hopefully the example walkthroughs provided here will help you in the same manner. I have also sorted these 21 methods into five larger categories to help remember the overall privesc threats to AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping into the 21 walkthroughs, you can refresh your AWS vocabulary with a glossary of relevant terms the glossary provided here."

    "### Description\n",
    "Users with the iam:CreatePolicyVersion permission are allowed to create a new version of an existing policy. Consequently, they can create a policy that allows more permissions than what they currently have.\n",
    "\n",

    "The iam:PassRole permission allows a user to pass a role to another AWS resource. The ec2:RunInstances permission allows a user to run EC2 instances. With these two permissions, the user can create a new EC2 instance which they have SSH access to, pass a role to the instance with permissions that the user does not have currently, log into the instance, and request AWS keys for the role.\n",

    "Note: There is not a specific privilege escalation path when using CloudFormation. Since the attacker can instruct CloudFormation to spin up AWS resources, there are various ways to go about this. For instance, creating a new user with admin permissions as used in the example below. Another options is to spin up an EC2 instance, pass the admin role to it, and then SSH into the instance, as described in one of the other privilege escalation techniques. Therefore, specific investigation is required of the roles that a user may pass to CloudFormation to see what privilege escalation paths might be possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Users with the iam:PassRole, datapipeline:CreatePipeline, datapipeline:PutPipelineDefinition, and datapipeline:ActivatePipeline permissions can create a new Data Pipeline, pass an existing role to it that has more permissions than what the user currently has, and then use the Data Pipeline to escalate privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "The AWS account needs to contain a role that can be assumed by Data Pipeline, and which has adequate permissions to escalate privileges. There is no defined list of what these permissions are because many escalation paths are possible through Data Pipeline.\n",
    "The AWS account needs to contain a second role that can be assumed by the service that the attacker wishes to use for privilege escalation.\n",
    "In the example below, that service is EC2. The role in this case is the same role assumed by Data Pipeline (adminaccess), but in practice they could be two separate roles.\n",
    "**Note**: There is not a specific privilege escalation path when using Data Pipeline. Since the attacker can instruct Data Pipeline to spin up AWS resources, there are various ways to go about this. For instance, adding a user to the Admin group as used in the example below. Another options is to spin up an EC2 instance, pass the admin role to it, and then SSH into the instance, as described in one of the other privilege escalation techniques. Therefore, specific investigation is required of the roles that a user may pass to Data Pipeline to see what privilege escalation paths might be possible.\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "In this example, the attacker is part of a single group. The group only provides the `iam:PassRole`, `datapipeline:CreatePipeline`, datapipeline:PutPipelineDefinition , and `datapipeline:ActivatePipeline` permissions:\n",
