# Problem Solving Techniques

### Summary

  * Never just straight go to the solution.
  * Involve other people in generating ideas.
  * Separate the generation of ideas from the judging of them
  * Use both logic and intuition.
  * Don't settle for the option if it's still not good enough.

### What's causing the problem?

  * Search for Causes of the problem.
  * Make a list of possible causes
  * Narrow it down to possible causes.

## The Kepner-Tregoe process

![](images/problem-solving-kepner-tregoe.jpg)

  1. Analyze **Situation**.
  2. Look at **Problem**
  3. Causes
  4. Identify **Solution**.
  5. **Select** best slution
  5. Consider Possible Risks.

## Pareto analysis

* Pareto principle - 20%/80%.
* Fix 20% problems causeing 80% of issues.

## Look at the whole system

  * Look around how change can be abused or used.
  * `Why Things Bite Back` - https://www.amazon.com/Why-Things-Bite-Back-Consequences/dp/0679747567
  * `The Fifth Dicipline` - humans a bad on thinking ahead.

## Fast and slow thinking

 * Focused and Diffused mode

## Brainstorming

  * Get and ideas first.
  * Judge later.


## Mind maps
  * Use midly or any other mind map applcaition.

## Decision trees
  * `subj`
    * if this 1 then that 1 ->
    * if this 2 then that 2 ->
    * if this 3 then that 3 ->




## Intuition and logic
* equalize logick and fun while malking decision.


## How to view the options
  * Waged factors/options.
  * See also `decision making with fuzzing advantages on alternatives set` [[1]](https://github.com/butuzov/CS122-KPI/tree/master/Decision-Theory/Control_Work_2), [[2]](https://github.com/butuzov/CS122-KPI/blob/master/Analytic-Ierarchy-Process/iararchy-analysys-methods)



## Rating charts

Similar to previous on `Options`. Simple charts for decision making.

| FACTOR |    | CAR vs Bike | Total: CAR vs Bike |
|--------|----|-------------|--------------------|
| Safety | 10 | 10  vs   1  |         10 vs 1    |
| Park   | 2  | 4   vs   6  |          8 vs 12   |
| Cool   | 10 | 5   vs   8  |         50 vs 40   |
|        |    |             |         68 vs 53   |

`Car won`


## Don't settle for second best
  Check all **Must have** and **Nice to have**.

## Risk analysis
  Try to calc a best possible option for you.

## Team decisions
  * Team decision tends to be risky.
  * Designated "black hat wearer"

## Sensitivity
  How sensitive solution to change? Is small change eq big impact?

## The sunk cost paradox
  You need to know when **to stop** wasting resources (time and money).


## Framing â€“ subconscious and deliberate
  * Ask question with different angles?
  * With bias and without it.

## Four simple rules for decision making

  * I decision is very close - option does not matter.
  * Toss a coin with option in mind.
  * Simplest solution.
  * Delegate decision.

### Consider implementation

  * Are you ready to implement solution? To use it? To learn it? TO fiddle with it?
